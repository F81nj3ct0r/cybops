<h3> CybOps Project Portfolio </h3>
This is a portfolio that was put together by a group of us for our Cyber Security Operations class we are taking. <br>
<br>
This documentation is to serve the purposes of: <br>
1.  Giving us a part of our grade in the class <br>
2.  Serving as POC's (in the sense that we did what we said we did for the class) <br>
3.  Providing us material for our resumes  <br>
4.  Helping us learn a few things along the way <br>
<br>
If you like the content, follow all of us contributers and I am certain we will come out with more content soon! <br>
<br>
Enjoy!
